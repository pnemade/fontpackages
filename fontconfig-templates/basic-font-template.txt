▶ Documentation for basic-font-template.conf

This basic fontconfig template is sufficient for the needs of most fonts. It
includes two rules:
— the first one tells fontconfig it can use the font named [fontname] when an
application asks for the generic family [genericname].
— the second one tells fontconfig it can complete the font named [fontname]
with glyphs taken from fonts registered under [genericname].

If you have more advanced needs, take a look at the other templates.

Please replace [fontname] and [genericname] with the appropriate values in the
following blocks of instructions.

A [fontname] example would be:
DejaVu Sans
It's the name under which the font appears in GUI font drop-downs.

Fontconfig generics ([genericname]) currently include:
— sans-serif
— serif
— monospace
— fantasy
– cursive

Processing the resulting file through xmllint with the "format" flag is usually
a good idea.
$ xmllint --format -o [XX]-[fontname].conf [yourfile]
The output file will be named:
[XX]-[fontname].conf
where [XX] should be a two-digit number corresponding to the font priority in
fontconfig.
