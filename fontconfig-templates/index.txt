1. Generic fontconfig documentation

— fontconfig-priorities.txt
  Conventions used to name and order fontconfig files
— fontconfig-generics.txt
  “Fake” synthetic font families used by fontconfig, and how to choose the
  correct one to register your font in

2. Fontconfig templates

Each use-case is illustrated by an XML template and the companion explanation
text file:
— basic-font-template.txt and basic-font-template.conf
  A no-frills template sufficient for most fonts
— substitution-font-template.txt and substitution-font-template.conf
  When you know your font is a good replacement for another font, and want the
  system to use your font when an application asks for this other font, and it
  is not available
— l10n-font-template.txt and l10n-font-template.conf
  When you need to increase the priority of your font, but only when writing
  text for a particular locale
— rescaling-font-template.txt and rescaling-font-template.conf
  When the font author made a scaling error, and the font appears too small or
  too big compared to other fonts at the same settings
— remapping-font-template.txt and remapping-font-template.conf
  When the font name or style declared by a font file does not respect
  conventions, and confuses applications or annoys users
— merging-font-template.txt and merging-font-template.conf
  When you need to make several font families appear as a single one,
  simplifying font management for users.
