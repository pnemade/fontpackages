▶ Documentation for substitution-font-template.conf

This advanced template adds one substitution rule to the basic template. Thus,
it includes three rules:
— the first one tells fontconfig it can use the font named [fontname] when an
application asks for the generic family [genericname].
— the second one tells fontconfig it can complete the font named [fontname]
with glyphs taken from fonts registered under [genericname].
— the third one tells fontconfig it can use [fontname] instead of
[otherfontname] if an application asks for [otherfontname].

The typical use-case is when you package [fontname], which is a derivative of
[otherfontname], and want the system to propose [fontname] if [otherfontname]
is not available.

If you have different needs, take a look at the other templates.

Please replace [fontname], [genericname], and [otherfontname] with the
appropriate values in the following blocks of instructions.

A [fontname] or [otherfontname] example would be:
DejaVu Sans
It's the name under which the font appears in GUI font drop-downs.

Fontconfig generics ([genericname]) currently include:
— sans-serif
— serif
— monospace
— fantasy
– cursive

Processing the resulting file through xmllint with the "format" flag is usually
a good idea.
$ xmllint --format -o [XX]-[fontname].conf [yourfile]
The output file will be named:
[XX]-[fontname].conf
where [XX] should be a two-digit number corresponding to the font priority in
fontconfig.
