▶ Documentation for rescaling-font-template.conf

This advanced template adds one rescaling rule to the basic template. Thus, it
includes three rules:
— the first one tells fontconfig it can use the font named [fontname] when an
application asks for the generic family [genericname].
— the second one tells fontconfig it can complete the font named [fontname]
with glyphs taken from fonts registered under [genericname].
– the third one rescales [fontname] by a factor of [factor].

The typical use-case is a font which original sizing does not fit well with the
other system fonts. We want to be able to replace fonts with other similar
fonts without the text size changing dramatically.

Of course it is much better get the font fixed upstream, since users of systems
without this rescaling rule will still draw the font using its original size.
That will make exchange of electronic documents that use this font impractical.

If you have different needs, take a look at the other templates.

Please replace [fontname], [genericname] and [factor] with the appropriate
values in the following blocks of instructions.

A [fontname] example would be:
DejaVu Sans
It's the name under which the font appears in GUI font drop-downs.

Fontconfig generics ([genericname]) currently include:
— sans-serif
— serif
— monospace
— fantasy
– cursive

A [factor] example would be:
1.2

Processing the resulting file through xmllint with the "format" flag is usually
a good idea.
$ xmllint --format -o [XX]-[fontname].conf [yourfile]
The output file will be named:
[XX]-[fontname].conf
where [XX] should be a two-digit number corresponding to the font priority in
fontconfig.
