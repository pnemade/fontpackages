rpm-font-tools is an LGPLv3+ file set intended to help people package new
fonts with rpm.

It implements packaging rules defined by the Fedora Fonts SIG
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Category:Fonts_SIG

However, it should not depend on any distribution-specific magic.

The home page of the project is:
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/fontpackages

And its content is published here:
— http://fedorahosted.org/releases/f/o/fontpackages (release archives)
— git://git.fedorahosted.org/fontpackages.git (content vcs)
— http://cvs.fedoraproject.org/viewvc/rpms/fontpackages/ (package vcs)
