The fontpackages project is an effort to streamline font packaging, helping
font packagers to produce clean, consistent and sane packages.

It contains:
— spec templates and rpm macros
– fontconfig templates and documentation
— sanity testing tools

… and any other material we feel can help font packagers in their work. New
templates are added whenever a new packaging pattern is identified.

The fontpackages project was initiated by the Fedora Fonts Special Interest
Group (http://fonts.fedoraproject.org/), and is the reference for Fedora font
packaging guidelines. It is therefore a bit rpm-oriented. However great care
was extended to keep it distribution-neutral, and contributors from
other distributions are welcome, even if they use different packaging systems,
and want to add non-rpm templates.

It is licensed under the LGPLv3 (or later).
